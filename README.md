# torch-model-derivation
Input dataset and target accuracy and the pipeline will ouput a dense model, ideally one that was reasonably easy to train and size optimized.


Currently learning 3d SuperSimplex Noise.  
Will make this 2d with image generation and layered 2d noise for a more complex function?

## How to run:
`cargo run --release`

## Tensorboard:
`tensorboard --logdir=tensorboard`
